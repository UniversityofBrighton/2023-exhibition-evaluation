## Step 6: Choose appropriate methods/tools to collect evidence

In this step, you will have to choose the methods to collect evidence for your evaluation. You can add your notes about data collection methods in the Evaluation Plan next to the objectives and metrics or use a separate document/sheet of paper to note them down.

The choice of data collection methods depends on different criteria, such as the type of data we need to collect, time to dedicate to evaluation, cost, available staff, space/place of the evaluation, type of audience, language and other.

Some of the standard methods to collect evidence during evaluation are:

- Interviews
- Focus groups
- Questionnaires/surveys
- Observations
- Graffiti walls
- Visual methods (e.g., drawings with children).


Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Some work best for a certain type of data we want to gather (e.g. interviews to gather qualitative insights), while others can enable more independent feedback and require less resources (e.g. graffiti walls). 

Participants will have to be informed about the collection of data when this happens, and they will have to provide consent. In some cases, covert data collection (for instance through observation) might happen, yet there should be a sign somewhere in the museum/gallery notifying visitors about observation taking place and visitors would still have to provide consent for data to be used in the research often retrospectively.

Lastly, to perform data collection, mechanisms/tools to record, store, study, preserve, analyse and visualise data exist.

Some of the practical details to take into account with regards to certain data collection methods are:

- **Interviews** can be conducted online or face to face. Audio equipment should be used in face to face interviews and then tools to transcribe this material will be needed. Online interviews can be recorded, and some video conferencing software offers automatic transcription.
- **Surveys** can be done on paper, yet a web-based survey (using tools like [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/), [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/welcome) and [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)) can facilitate data collection, analysis and presentation.
- **Observations** need a clearly designed protocol, so that researchers/staff know what to look for when observing visitor behaviours.
