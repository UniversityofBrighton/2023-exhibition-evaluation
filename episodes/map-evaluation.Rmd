## Step 4: Map evaluation through the evaluation planning tool

In this step, you will map evaluation by using the evaluation planning tool. This can be downloaded from the Share Museums East (2020). Evaluation Toolkit for Museums. Pages 79-80. Retrieved from: [https://www.sharemuseumseast.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SHARE_Evaluation_Toolkit_FINAL_WEB.pdf](https://www.sharemuseumseast.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SHARE_Evaluation_Toolkit_FINAL_WEB.pdf) or you can use a similar template, which you can find [here](files/evaluation_plan.pdf). 


The sections of the Evaluation Plan require the following information about the context of the digital experience you plan to evaluate:

- **Inputs**: These are the inputs invested in the project/application to produce outputs. Inputs include resources like time, finances, staff, and facilities.
- **Aims**: Aims are specific and intentional goals to achieve. Aims frame the desired outcome/s or purpose towards which efforts and actions are directed. An example of an aim could be: ‘to increase access to our collection for visually impaired visitors’.
- **Objectives**: Objectives outline the necessary actions to accomplish your aim/s and can serve to evaluate the project or activity. Objectives can be perceived as steps to achieve aims. Examples of objectives could be: ‘to enhance the interpretation of our collection/s for visually impaired audiences with the use of technology’, ‘to enable independent exploration of our collection with the use of technology for visually impaired audiences’, ‘to increase the numbers of visually impaired users who visit our museum’.
- **Outputs**: Outputs include everything produced as a result, such as courses, exhibitions, and talks, as well as metrics like attendance numbers. Outputs also comprise developed resources like handbooks, websites, or future plans. Similarly to the above examples, an output could be ‘a tactile exploration of replicas of our figurines with the aid of a mobile audio application’, ‘a tactile map with audio support at the entrance of the museum’.
- **Outcomes**: Outcomes reflect the overall result of outputs and the difference these will make. Outcomes usually involve qualitative measures that illustrate the effect of the project/application on individuals or groups. Outcomes can have effect/s for different stakeholders. In the context of the above examples, the outcome of a project could be ‘increased access and enjoyment of the collection for visually impaired users’.

If you have developed a project canvas for a digital experience through other tutorials (e.g. [Digital Exhibition Design tutorial](https://universityofbrighton.github.io/2023-exhibition-design/index.html)) you can use that information to map all the above.
