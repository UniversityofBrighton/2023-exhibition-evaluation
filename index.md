Evaluation is a critical task, given that gathering and making sense of audience feedback enables museum professionals to reflect upon their work, while tracing the impact of organisations’ provision and shaping digital policies and plans. This resource discusses various approaches and methods to evaluate digital or hybrid interactive experiences, which support the interpretation of heritage assets. The resource also aims to support researchers’ and practitioners’ practical understanding of evaluation methods and tools to capture audiences' engagement with media and explore technology impact.
